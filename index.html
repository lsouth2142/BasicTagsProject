  <h3>Scuba diving in the Bonne Terre Mines!</h3>
  <div class="about"> 
  <p>One of my favorite spots to go scuba diving in the Mid-West is hands down Bonne Terre Mines. Bonne Terre Mines is <br>
an abbandoned mine that was considered mined out around 30+ years ago. After you walk down in to the mine via the <br> Mule Entrance, 
the mine opens up to show just how big it is.
</p>
</div>
<p>By the time you get down to the water level you feel as though you have just completed a long hike!
  <h4>Reasons for that are:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You have to carry all of your gear in to the mine</li>
  <li>There are a ton of steps to walk down</li>
  <li>SCUBA diving gear is heavy</li>
  <li>The walk down and in to the mine has alot fo rough terrain</li>
</ul>
